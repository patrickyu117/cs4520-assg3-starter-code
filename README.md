What is this application:<br>
--This application is an implementation of a simple calculator, with functions of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing 2 numbers.<br>
--There are two ways this was implemented, with a Model-View-Presenter and Model-View-ViewModel implementation.<br>
<br>
--Once a user loads in, the main screen will be where the user can select between either implementation.<br>
--Both implementations will function exactly the same, the only difference to the user is the color of the background, and for the MVVM implementation the result of the calculation will survive orientation change.<br>
<br> 
How to run the application:<br> 
--To run this app, simply import all of the files into Android Studio. Once all the files are imported, run the application using an Android phone emulator.<br> 
<br>
Application structure:<br> 
-- There are folder containing the 2 implementations titled MVP and MVVM.<br>
-- Each folder contains their respective parts necessary to implement the simple calculator.<br>
-- Files needed for both implementations such as the MainActivity, HomeFragment that is the initial screen, and the CalculatorModel that is used for both implementations are
all available outside of those files.
